          Course Outline
        </h3>

            <p>The course will combine group reading and discussion of influential publications in cloud computing, some lectures by instructor and by invited speakers, independent review of talks coupled with classroom discussion, and a large project.</p>

            <p>For the most part, the course will be flipped, with most of the material independently studied, and then group discussion of the material.</p>

            <p>The project will be done by teams of 3 to 5 students working with an industry leader.</p>

             <p>This course will exploit the <a href="http://www.bu.edu/hic/research/massachusetts-open-cloud/">MOC</a> as well as industry clouds (Amazon AWS, Google cloud, Rackspace, ...)</p>


            <p>Course will give students:</p>
            <ul>
            <li> understanding of cloud computing at the IaaS level in general, and open stack in particular
            <li> understanding and experience with working as part of an agile team, with experience in running and participating in  scrums, planning sessions, ...
            <li> extensive experience with github, agile tools, python, emacs, and other modern development tools
            <li> an artifact that they will have developed that, if successful, will be part of  a broader initiative
            <li> experience working in a research environment, and
            <li> a report, that, if successful, will be submitted as a publication.</p>
            </ul>

<h3>
<a name="workload" class="anchor" href="#workload"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Workload:
</h3>

<p>Each week we will be covering on average two research papers and one practitioner paper or other teaching material. You will be expected to read, review and discuss. These papers will likely require that you find and read additional material as necessary to ensure your comprehension. Do not underestimate the amount of work this can be. You will be required to submit a written review of the papers prior to class. You will also be expected to actively participate in the in class discussion. Each student is expected to lead one more of the class discussions by summarizing the paper and seeding discussions with questions and observations based on the paper.</p>

<p>In addition, to the weekly papers, there will be a major project. This
will be teams of 3 to 5 students, starting from the course beginning, with a
mentor, from industry, senior graduate student, or one of the instructors.

<p>The project is due by the end of the exam week.
The project presentations will be given in the form of a final poster and a demo.
There will also be demos scheduled throughout the course to demonstrate regular progress.</p>



<p>Some example projects are given below. Feel free to contact one of the instructors if you wish to propose your own projects</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="PROJECTS/OSonOCX.html">MOC build OS APIs on top of OS, using ocx library</a>
<li> <a href="PROJECTS/recursiveHaaS.html">recursive HaaS with fast provisioning</a>
<li> <a href="PROJECTS/MOC-UI.html">Extending the MOC UI</a>
<li> <a href="PROJECTS/buNews.html">build a social news serving system</a>
<li> <a href="PROJECTS/buLive.html">build a live video streaming and sharing system</a>
<li> <a href="">provide archival and example applications around the commonwealth open data intiative, pulling down and archiving data sets...</a>
<li> <a href="">integrate OCX library into big data platform</a>
<li> <a href="">build a reputation system into MOC UI</a>
<li> <a href="">improved monitoring for open stack</a>
<li> <a href="">integrate x-trace into open stack http://www.x-trace.net/wiki/doku.php</a>
<li> <a href="">build a mobile video sharing system that enables live sharing of mobile videos</a>

</ul>

<p> Come back for more details in sample projects. This list will be updated constantly. </p>

<p>Public or not nature of the projects should be discussed with the mentors from the beginning.</p>

<p>There will be no final exam.</p>

<h3>
<a name="grading" class="anchor" href="#grading"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tentative Grading:
</h3>

<ul>
<li >paper discussions (written and verbal) 30%
<li> project proposal 10% 
<li> bi-weekly project demo and verbal status in aggregate 30%
<li> final project result and report 30%
</ul>

<p>Evaluation of project will involve evaluation of demo, poster, code reviews, weekly review of agile progress, and mentor and project partner reviews.</p>

<h3>
<a name="weekly" class="anchor" href="#weekly"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Weekly schedule:
</h3>

<p>The first two weeks we will course intro, agile methods, project pitches from potential mentors, After that. Every week we will cover a paper two papers on cloud computing, one disucssion topic on agile development, and spend one hour on demoes from a subset of the projects. Project teams will be expected to give a demo every second week. </p>

<p>That is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>two weeks of intro, and project picking
  <li>two weeks of describing projects
  <li>after that demos
</ul>
